# Y10K

*Simplified Yum repository management from the year 10,000 AD*

Y10K is a tool to deploy Yum/RPM repositories and mirrors in your local
environment using settings described in a INI formatted `Yumfile`.

Y10K is inspired by tools such as Puppet's [R10K](https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k)
and Ruby's [Bundler](http://bundler.io/gemfile.html).
